Layoffs Data Cleaning Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and processing a layoffs dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. The dataset contains information on company layoffs, industries, locations, funding, and other key attributes. The script performs essential data cleaning tasks, including:

Removing Duplicates: Identifying and eliminating duplicate entries.
Standardizing Data: Ensuring uniform capitalization, correcting spelling errors, and trimming spaces.
Handling NULL Values: Filling missing data where possible and removing unusable records.
Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Keeping only relevant data for better performance.
The cleaned dataset can be used for further analysis, visualization, and insights into global layoffs trends.
